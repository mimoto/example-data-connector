# An attempt to make a custom data connector for Shibboleth IDPv4

The data connector doesn't currently work.

When it works it won't do anything useful except be an implementation of a data connector.

I've tried to keep it as simplistic as possible.

The data connector source is in "src"

The attribute-resolver.conf is in idp/optfs/shibboleth-idp/conf
